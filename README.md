Weather App 

A weather website is a website that provides users with information about current and forecasted weather conditions for a specific location. The website typically obtains its data from meteorological agencies or other sources and presents the information in a user-friendly format. Users can usually customize the website to show temperature, wind speed, precipitation, humidity, and other weather-related data. Some weather websites also provide interactive maps and radar images, allowing users to see the weather conditions in real-time. Additionally, many weather websites offer severe weather alerts and notifications, allowing users to stay informed about weather conditions that may impact their safety or plans. Overall, a weather website is a useful tool for anyone who wants to stay up-to-date with the weather conditions in their area.
